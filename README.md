# Autoclicker
 As the name suggests.  
 
 Intervals are specified directly in the code, because I'm lazy.  

# For the autoclicker:
 
Press 'n' to toggle the autoclicker.  

Press ‘t’ to toggle a loop doing the following:
- Click, wait the interval’s time, then click again.
- Wait .1 seconds
- Move the mouse by the specified offset and click again
- Wait .1 seconds
- Move the mouse back to its starting point and repeat
Long story what I use this for.

Press 'z' to test the offset.

Press ‘m’ to exit the program.

# For the screenshot-taker:

Literally just specify the region you want a screenshot of in the code, and when the code runs it takes the picture. I was feeling lazy.
